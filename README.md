### A tiny game

A popular oral game among students, I programmed it and made a computer player with the secret of the game. It will judge the way to win according to the player's action, and there is only one way to defeat it.

Rules of the game:
It is up to the player to choose whether to start first, and then each side will say up to three consecutive numbers from the number "1", eventually forced to say the number "21" one side fails.
